# Bubble-Sort

Goal is to analyze how different implementations of the same algorithm can have an impact on runtime. 

The results are printed tab deliniated, with each run in a separate line.

## To Run
gcc -std=gnu99 util/bubble_sort.c util/arrays.c main.c

### Side Note
This code does not run on MacOS X machines (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5167269/clock-gettime-alternative-in-mac-os-x). Use a linux machine (like Vega or Remus at Amherst College).
